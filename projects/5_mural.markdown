In Partnership with Fifth Third Bank and The University of Cincinnati (UC). During this project, I led a group of peers in creating a mural celebrating the senior athletes on UC's men's and women's basketball teams. The installation served as a way to assist Fifth Third Bank in connecting with UC Basketball fans.
