A Moment of Our Time is a website comprising of responses from the community answering prompts written by myself. My prompts are intended to get the participant to recognize the loaded meaning of certain public spaces and connect with those meanings in relation to their own lives. During the past year, the conventions of human interaction have changed dramatically. I chose to confront interaction in my work, by creating a space for digital interactions, informed by physical spaces that were once havens for person to person contact. The work consists of both a website and printed media. Participants in A Moment of Our Time encountered a flier with a QR code leading to a separate prompt page, which displayed a prompt and an anonymous submission form allowing for the participant to respond. Participant’s responses are posted anonymously on the site. Prompts during this run of the project were concentrated in the Cincinnati area.</p>
